        "1. What I did here: EEG → EEG_emb → action_latent → distillation with text_emb -> motion\n",
        "2. In MotionLCM_EEG.ipynb, model doesn't need to learn \"what the action is,\" it only needs to learn \"which point in the teacher embedding corresponds to this EEG.\" Here, the model learns an \"action space\" instead of directly memorizing the embeddings.\n",
        "3. action_latent provides a smoother temporal transition. Without action_latent, for a known EEG, the motion closely matches the prompt, but slight changes in the EEG (noise, time shift) can cause sudden changes in the generated motion. With action_latent, similar EEGs → similar latents → similar motions result in more stable generation of continuous motions.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Future thinking:\n",
        "1. Latent interpolation → motion interpolation: Take the EEG (eg. walk ↔ squat) interpolation latent values ​​of the two labels, generate motion using MotionLCM, and check if the motion exhibits continuous change.\n",
        "2. EEG → action latent → motion: without text-to-motion, but need EEG ↔ Motion dataset."
